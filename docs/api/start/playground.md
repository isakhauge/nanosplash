# Playground

Here you can play around with Nanosplash and see how it works.

<PlayGround />

Open your browser console (developer tools).

- macOS: `⌘` `⌥` `i`
- Windows: `Ctrl` `⇧` `i`

Try to target different elements in the DOM. Nanosplash is available in the window scope as `ns`. Give it a shot!
